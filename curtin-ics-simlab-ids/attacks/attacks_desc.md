# Objective-Based Attacks
Real-world cyber-attacks do not happen in isolation. Different attacks are perform at different stages to achieve an overall goal. The following objectives represent procedures of cyber-attacks performed in unison to achieve an overall goal. 

The procedure attack use attacks defined in the python attack script `attacker.py`.

`auto_attacker.py` contains code to run certain attacks within these objectives.

### Objective 1: Reconnaissance
1. address scan for PLCs
2. function code scans for valid Modbus function codes
3. device identification attack
3. naive sensor read to find used registers

### Objective 2: Sporadic Injections
1. address scan for PLCs
2. naive sensor read to find used registers
3. sporadic sensor measurement

### Objective 3: Disable service through Force Listen Mode
1. address scan
2. force listen mode to found IPs

### Objective 4: Disable service through Restart Communication
1. address scan
2. restart communication attack to found IPs

### Objective 5: Attempt to find device-related exploits
1. address scan
2. device identification attack

### Objective 6: DOS Servers
1. connection flood attack
2. data flood attack
